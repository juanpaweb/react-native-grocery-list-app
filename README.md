# react-native-grocery-list-app
**Tested on a ANDROID emulator. Has NOT been tested on an IOS device.**  
More or less an improved version of my react-native-to-do-list app. This one is able to save the data  
and be persistent. Also(IMO) it looks better.
** Requires `expo-cli` to run **

## To Run
**Emulator/Device is required**
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/snekplex/react-native-grocery-list-app.git` and cd into `react-native-grocery-list-app`
2. Install packages with either `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the `npm start` or `yarn start` command to run the app with expo.
4. Wait for the browser based metro bundler to say the tunnel is ready before proceeding.
5. Then if running on **LAN** with an emulator open(ex: Emulator from Android Studio(AVD)) press `Run on android device/emulator`
6. If this is a new device(At least if it is a android emulator) it will install the expo app, then run the projects app.
7. Once the Javascript is bundled test out the app.

## Note:
This app was tested on a Pixel 3a AVD(Android Virtual Device) from Android Studio.  
With this in consideration some of the placements of the text(mainly the DELETE text) may be off.
